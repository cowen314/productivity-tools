Inputs: TradeQty(1), ORHigh(0), ORLow(0), p0(4), p1(8), p2(12), p3(16);

// Capture the high and the low

// TODO place horizontal markers on the candlestick to indicate high and low

// Plot1(ORHigh);

// Trade logic

// OPT1: could place stop orders (immediately) like this:
// buy 4*TradeQty stop order at ORHigh
// short sell 4*TradeQty stop order at ORLow
